## Introduction

[Explainers](/explainers/example-explainer.md) are documents that describe user, developer, or customer problems at a high level and explore potential solutions. These documents serve as starting points for community discussion and engagement.

Each Explainer aims to:
- Present problems in clear, accessible language
- Propose solutions that are easy to understand
- Avoid excessive technical detail
- Enable readers to form informed opinions about proposed solutions

## Active Explainers ðŸ“£
